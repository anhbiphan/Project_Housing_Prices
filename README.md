#### Goals  
- Find the price range of the majority of the houses.
  - Compare house sizes and prices per zip code.
  - Create price prediction model.
  - Prediction model.
  - Find the price range of the majority of the houses.

- Data used: King County dataset, years 2014-2015.
- Metric: average prediction within +/-11.7%.
- Average Price: ~$490,000
- Median Price: $440,000
- Prices Range: less then $1.3 mln 
  - 96% of the data was below $1.3 million

#### Business Problems:
- What area is in my price range? What area has the best price per sqft?
- What is the average price for that zip code?
- Where are alternative areas with the same house features but more affordable price?
#### Solutions:
- Removing data above $1.3 million (Crazy outliers above $1.3 mill)
- Selecting the right features and checking score results of models.
#### Recommendations for further developments:
- More recent data for current estimate.
- Predictions for how houses will appreciate or depreciate in value over time.
- Improve model.

## Project Intro/Objective
  We displayed house sizes, prices per zip code, price per sqft, price ranges, and home features with data visuals.
  Having visuals allowed us to identify the price differences for zip codes.
  With the data what was given to us, we also created a price prediction model. We trained and tested our model to predict      future prices given the features that the model has trained on. 
  Some of the features that we used were 
  - 'price'
  - 'bedrooms'
  - 'bathrooms'
  - 'sqft_living'
  - 'sqft_lot'
  - 'floors'
  - 'grade'
  - 'sqft_above'
  - 'sqft_basement'
  - 'zipcode'
  - 'lat'
  - 'long'
  - 'sqft_living15'
  - 'sqft_lot15'
  
## Project Findings:
- Features such as 'id', 'date', 'waterfront', 'view', 'condition', 'yr_built', and 'yr_renovated' did not help too much on predicting price.
- From our data visuals, zip code (along with Latitude and Longitude) seem to play a big factor on prices. 
- From the Decision Tree Regressor the MAE increased after transforming and scaling features. (Possibly overfitting)
- From Random Forest the MAE also increased after transforming and scaling features. (Possibly overfitting)
- Both Decision Tree and Random Forest R2 score did improve by ~ 2-5%.
- GAM model with tensor terms(e.g., zip code with coordinates) showed good results.
- Reducing number of features didnt improve results of the regression models(Linear, MARS and GAM).

### Metrics Used:
- Mean Absolute Error: we wanted to see the average error in dollars that the models predicted.
- Mean Absolute percentage error: we wanted to see mean % of error. this metric used to complement mean abs.error. 
- R2 score: we wanted to see what percentage of variation are coming from the features we use.

## Project Description
Since the data provided was 2014-2015, we did not have the most earliest data to train our model. Some of the hypothesis questions that we had was if location influenced price. Things such as longitute/ latitude or zipcode.
We created a map to input the data and saw that some zipcodes had a higher average price and some lower. 


## Needs of this project
- frontend/backend developers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- real estate agents/companies
- housing price/sales
- house price predictions
- buyer and seller references
